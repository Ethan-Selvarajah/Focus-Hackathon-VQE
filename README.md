# TKS-Focus-Hackathon-VQE
# This is the code for a Variational Quantum Eigensolver. It is a quantum-classical hybrid system. The quantum computer's job is to evaluate the energy of the system passed into the quantum computer, which progressively gets nearer to the ground state. The classical computerâ€™s job is to decide how to improve the parameters so that the energy is lower on the next run.
# At a high level, the VQE uses a parameterized quantum circuit to calculate the cost and combines it with an optimizer running on a classical computer.
